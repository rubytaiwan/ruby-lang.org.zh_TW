Wondering why Ruby is so popular?  Its fans call it a beautiful, artful language.  And yet, they say it's handy and practical.  What gives?

h3. The Ideals of Ruby's Creator

!>{padding-left:8px}http://redhanded.hobix.com/images/ruby-lang-matz.png!

Ruby is a language of careful balance.  Its creator, <a href="http://www.rubyist.net/~matz/">Yukihiro "matz" Matsumoto</a>, blended parts of his favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp) to form a new language that balanced functional programming with imperative programming.

He has often said that he is "trying to make Ruby natural, not simple," in a way that mirrors life.

Building on this, he adds:

bq. Ruby is simple in appearance, but is very complex inside, just like our human body[1].

h3. About Ruby's Growth

Since its public release in 1995, Ruby has drawn devoted coders worldwide.  In 2006, Ruby achieved mass acceptance.  With active user groups formed in the world's major cities and Ruby-related conferences filled to capacity.

Ruby-Talk, the primary "mailing list":/en/community/mailing-lists/ for discussion of the Ruby language has climbed to an average of 200 messages per day.
 
The TIOBE index, which measures the growth of programming languages, ranks Ruby as #9 among programming languages worldwide.  Much of the growth is attributed to the popularity of software written in Ruby, particularly the Ruby on Rails web framework[2].

Ruby is also "totally free":./license.txt.  Not only free of charge, but also free to use, copy, modify, and distribute.

h3. Seeing Everything as an Object

Initially, Matz looked at other languages to find an ideal syntax.  Recalling his search, he said, "I wanted a scripting language that was more powerful than Perl, and more object-oriented than Python[3]."

In Ruby, everything is an object.  Every bit of information and code can be given their own properties and actions.  Object-oriented programming calls properties by the name _instance variables_ and actions are known as _methods_.  Ruby's pure object-oriented approach is most commonly demonstrated by a bit of code which applies an action to a number.

<notextile><r:code>
5.times { print "We *love* Ruby -- it's outrageous!" }
</r:code></notextile>

In many languages, numbers and other primitive types are not objects.  Ruby follows the influence of the Smalltalk language by giving methods and instance variables to all of its types.  This eases one's use of Ruby, since rules applying to objects apply to all of Ruby.

h3. Ruby's Flexibility

Ruby is seen as a flexible language, since it allows its users to freely alter its parts.  Essential parts of Ruby can be removed or redefined, at will.  Existing parts can be added upon.  Ruby tries not to restrict the coder.

For example, addition is performed with the plus (@+@) operator.  But, if you'd rather use the readable word @plus@, you could add such a method to Ruby's builtin @Numeric@ class.

<notextile><r:code>
class Numeric
  def plus(x)
    self.+(x)
  end
end

y = 5.plus 6
# y is now equal to 11
</r:code></notextile>

Ruby's operators are syntactic sugar for methods. You can redefine them as well.

h3. Blocks, a Truly Expressive Feature

Ruby's block are also seen as a source of great flexibility.  A programmer can attach a closure to any method, describing how that method should act.  The closure is called a _block_ and has become one of the most popular features for newcomers to Ruby from other imperative languages like PHP or Visual Basic.

Blocks are inspired by functional languages.  Matz said, "in Ruby closures, I wanted to respect the Lisp culture[4]."

<notextile><r:code>
search_engines = 
  %w[Google Yahoo MSN].map do |engine|
    "http://www." + engine.downcase + ".com"
  end
</r:code></notextile>

In the above code, the block is described inside the @do ... end@ construct.  The @map@ method applies the block to the provided list of words.  Many other methods in Ruby leave a hole open for a coder to write their own block to fill in the details of what that method should do.

h3. Ruby and the Mixin

Unlike many object-oriented languages, Ruby features single inheritance only, *on purpose*. But Ruby knows the
concept of modules (called Categories in Objective-C). Modules are collections
of methods.

Classes can mixin a module and receive all its methods for free.  For example, any class which implements the @each@ method can mixin the @Enumerable@ module, which adds a pile of methods that use @each@ for looping.

<notextile><r:code>
class MyArray
  include Enumerable
end
</r:code></notextile>

Generally, Rubyists see this as a much clearer way than multiple inheritance, which is complex and can be too restrictive.

h3. Ruby's Visual Appearance

While Ruby often uses very limited punctuation and usually prefers English keywords, some punctuation is used to decorate Ruby.  
Ruby needs no variable declarations. It uses simple naming conventions to
denote the scope of variables. 

* @var@ could be a local variable.
* @@var@ is an instance variable.
* @$var@ is a global variable.

These sigils enhance readability by allowing the programmer to easily identify the roles of each variable.  It also becomes unnecessary to use a tiresome @self.@ prepended to every instance member.

h3. Beyond the Basics

Ruby has a wealth of other features, among which are the following:

* Ruby has exception handling features, like Java or Python, to make it easy to
handle errors.

* Ruby features a true mark-and-sweep garbage collector for all Ruby
objects. No need to maintain reference counts in extension
libraries.  As Matz says, "This is better for your health."

* Writing C extensions in Ruby is easier than in Perl or Python, with a very elegant
API for calling Ruby from C.  This includes calls for embedding Ruby in software, for use
as a scripting language.  A SWIG interface is also available.

* Ruby can load extension libraries dynamically if an OS allows.

* Ruby features OS independent threading. Thus, for all platforms on which Ruby
runs, you also have multithreading, regardless of if the OS supports it or not,
even on MS-DOS!

* Ruby is highly portable: it is developed mostly on GNU/Linux, but works on many
types of UNIX, Mac OS X, Windows 95/98/Me/NT/2000/XP, DOS, BeOS, OS/2, etc.
